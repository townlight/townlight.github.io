The signed Windows x64 beta 1.7.0.1 passed fresh Windows Sandbox acceptance
with synthetic data. The release includes the MSI, matching source, checksums
and an [acceptance summary](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/download/townlight-beta-1-windows-1.7.0.1/ACCEPTANCE-Windows-1.7.0.1.md).
Earlier releases retain their original identities and acceptance evidence. City-specific policies, staff and equipment still
require commissioning. Station uses a pinned CivicCast media implementation;
standalone CivicCast remains a separate product. Current owned code and manuals
are AGPL-3.0-only, with retained historical grants and vendor notices.

The current Windows acceptance covers the paired-loopback Meetings → Station → Records handoff using a synthetic recorded file. Historical Station delivery evidence does not establish live broadcast, external upload or city deployment acceptance for this MSI.


## Separately deployed resident portal beta

[Portal release and downloads](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/tag/townlight-beta-1-resident-portal) · [Portal guide](https://townlight.github.io/manuals/portal.html). Includes the approved city-facing website and the Meetings → Station → Records publication workflow. Deploy the portal and matching native bridge separately; the portal and bridge use their own release and deployment steps. Acceptance uses synthetic data; CivicCast remains separate.

## Site source and maintenance

Dependency-free static HTML/CSS/SVG documentation. GitHub Pages serves `main` at
the repository root; `.nojekyll` preserves the portable file layout. `products/`
contains the product landing pages, `manuals/` the operating guides, `api/` exact protocol/schema
references, `pdf/` and `docx/` printable/editable editions, and `reference/`
version/provenance/workflow evidence. `terms.html` includes terms and the full
license; current owned content is AGPL-3.0-only.

Preview with a loopback-only static server. Check relative links, headings, the
first keyboard skip link, visible focus, reduced-motion behavior, image loading,
console errors and desktop/mobile overflow. Preserve the accepted companion ZIP
and its hash; publication banners describe the distribution change separately.
Publishing this site does not install an application or provision a city portal.
